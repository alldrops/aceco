					<h2>Hi! We’re Geoff & Lenay. We are owner operators of Aceco Appliance Rentals Sydney.</h2>
					<div class="text">
						<p>
							With very active lifestyles ourselves, we totally understand the need for things to just work and for life to be made as convenient as possible. We’ve been providing appliance rental services to Sydney residents for over 15 years, ensuring a value for money option was on the market - without compromising on customer service.

							We have a very active family - we all LOVE our sports and compete regularly. We’re very proud of our children who are accomplished athletes. One of our children has competed at the Commonwealth games and the other is on a development squad for Athletics Australia. As well as supporting the kids, Lenay plays netball and Geoff loves to surf and swims regularly. Geoff also sings loudly and cooks often.
						</p>
						<p>
							We keep very busy and have plenty of washing and eating happening in our house (with all those high metabolisms and sports uniforms!) and spend plenty of time relying on the convenience of our appliances.

								WE PROVIDE <span>QUALITY APPLIANCES</span> ON <span>SHORT TERM FLEXIBLE OPTIONS</span> TO PEOPLE IN THE SYDNEY METRO AREA, DRIVEN TO YOU DIRECT BY ONE OF OUR STAFF DRIVERS.

					<h3>Our team.</h3>
					<div class="text">
						<p>
							We have a great team of reliable servicemen, delivery drivers and customer service people to help you at any point of your hire. Everyone we work with has the same attitude towards customer service as we do - smiles are free of charge.
						</p>
						<p>
							It’s important to us to offer you genuine service and value for money on great quality products, which is why we began our business all those years ago. All of our appliances are serviced regularly, and replaced on 5 yearly cycles, so you won’t receive senior citizen appliances on our watch! 
						</p>
						<p>
							On the off chance that anything could go wrong with your appliance (this can happen at any age with any appliance - completely sporadic!) we have inhouse repairmen, and offer services free of charge to keep you running for the duration of your lease.

					<h3>Our promise to you.</h3>

						<p>
							If anything should break down more permanently, we will deliver a replacement and remove the old appliance at the earliest convenient time - same day if possible! All of our delivery and collection services are free of charge anywhere in the Sydney Metro area - upstairs or otherwise.
						</p>
						<p>
							Let us save your back and the cost of hiring transport and energy involved in installing your appliance in its position without causing any damage to surrounding surfaces by providing all that for you - <span>FREE OF CHARGE!</span>
						</p>
						<p>
							We are really looking forward to meeting you and helping you with your appliance needs. We are totally happy to help you meet any odd requirements regarding to the size and shape of the appliance and hope we can come up with a short term flexible solution to get you settled as soon as possible.
