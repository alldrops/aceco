							Has your hired fridge stopped working? Is your washing machine not turning on or spitting out water? We can have a reliable repair person on their way to service your machine as soon as possible. In the interim, we’d love to be able to help by talking over the problem on the phone. With over 15 years experience, we may have a tip or trick to get you a little extra mileage until the repair person can arrive.

							At Aceco, our service doesn’t cease the moment you sign a contract. We love to help our customers and provide the same customer experience for the entirety of your hire period.

							Should you need our help, you need only call 9817 0292 to discuss the problem, and have us find you a solution as soon as possible, to minimise the inconvenience you face. Sometimes its only a matter of a few easy questions to one of our customer service staff and the problem can be fixed over the phone.

						<p>
							If we can’t provide a solution over the phone we will organise a repair person to come and inspect and repair the problem in your home. We only use the most trustworthy repair people Sydney has to offer.

							In the event that your machine has completely broken down, we will have it replaced with the closest possible option with 2 days to ensure you aren’t without. That’s the beauty of hiring your appliances - no service issues, no stress!
