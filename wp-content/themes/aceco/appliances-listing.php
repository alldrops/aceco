					<h3>A fridge is a modern day necessity for most.</h3>
					<div class="text">
						<p>
							They can cost a pretty penny when you purchase upfront, can be a difficult appliance to move and won’t always meet the requirements you need in regards to size and the space to house it. Maybe the door won’t swing the right way when you move. There are plenty of things to consider, and a broad choice of fridges on the market – so how do you know which one will suit you best long term? Why purchase up front, when you can rent and get value for money without all the hassle and permanence of owning.
						</p>
						<p>	 
							No one likes organising the maintenance on appliances, and fridges can be tricky business with seals and temperature gauges and all the rest. Don’t risk buying your own fridge for the short term only to have to move and sell it. Let the experienced team at Aceco handle the tough stuff like servicing and size, so you just have to worry about what to put in it!
